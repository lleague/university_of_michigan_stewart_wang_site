Advanced automatic collision notification (AACN) has great potential to improve post-crash care if the risk of severe injury to a vehicle’s occupants can be accurately predicted. The National Expert Panel for Field Triage set a 20% risk of Injury Severity Score (ISS) 15+ injury [1] as the threshold for urgent transport to a trauma center. The objective of this study was to field test real world performance of the published injury severity prediction (ISP) algorithm in collisions involving recent model GM vehicles equipped with OnStar.\r\nThis study was approved by the IRB of the Michigan Department of Community Health. There were 924 occupants in 836 crash events, involving vehicles equipped with AACN capabilities, in the state of Michigan which were identified from the OnStar records. The police crash report corresponding to the event was identified in the State of Michigan database and used to confirm data sent by telemetry from the vehicle. The injury status of all occupants in the case vehicles was determined. Occupants not transported for medical evaluation were assumed to have ISS<15. For occupants transported from the scene for evaluation and treatment, medical records and imaging data were obtained from the treating facility. Case reviews were conducted to jointly analyze crash, vehicle telemetry, and injury outcome data. The algorithm was used to calculate the predicted risk of injury based on transmitted telemetry data and this prediction was compared to the observed injury outcome for each vehicle as well as each occupant.\r\nIn this field study, the ISP algorithm’s ability to predict whether a vehicle had a seriously injured (ISS>15) occupant was, in terms of sensitivity, at 63.64% compared to the model sensitivity of 39.6% and it also came very close to expectations of specificity at 96.12% compared to the model specificity of 98.3% with use of age and gender data. Without use of age and gender, for ISP calculation, the sensitivity performance was 45.45% while the specificity improved slightly to 97.58%. Detailed analysis of cases suggests that further performance gains could be obtained with more detailed definition of crash direction, seating position, and occupant age.\r\nThere were 184 candidate crash occupants in 167 vehicles not included in the study analysis due to: A) missing Police accident reports, n=77 in 75 crashes; B) inability to retrieve medical records, n = 71 in 61 crashes; or C) rollover event, n=36 in 31 crashes. Analysis of these excluded cases did not reveal any bias in crash severity or injury that would confound the current study findings.\r\nThis study confirms for the first time under real-world field conditions that occupant injury severity can be predicted using vehicle telemetry data. The ISP algorithm’s ability to predict a 20% or greater risk of severe (ISS15+) injury was better than anticipated and confirms ISP’s utility for the field triage of crash subjects. This analysis suggests that AACN technology can greatly facilitate the collection of field data with ISP also serving as a baseline for potential monitoring of the benefits resulting from vehicle safety design changes.','2017-09-20 16:13:30','2017-09-20 16:13:30','http://automotivemedicine.org/pdf/telemetry.pdf','using_telemetry_to_predict_injury_severity.png','image/png',147985,'2017-09-20 16:13:30'),(12,'Seeking Common Ground: UMHS works with Amish and Mennonite communities toward a culturally sensitive approach to burn treatment','When an Amish child is burned, perhaps by liquid in a canning pot or flames in the home\'s wood-burning stove, the family often turns to community healers.

It aims to measure the variation in stiffness due to shape that is seen throughout the population and, in particular, provide a tool for researchers to better understand the influence of shape on resulting stiffness. A previously published six-parameter shape model of the central axis of human ribs was used. It has been shown to accurately model the overall rib path using intrinsic geometric properties such as size, aspect ratio, and skewness, through shapes based on logarithmic spirals with high curvature continuity. In this study the model was fitted to 19,500 ribs from 989 adult female and male CT scans having demographic distributions matching the US adult population. Mechanical loading was simulated through a simplified finite element model aimed at isolating rib shape from other factors influencing mechanical response. Four loading scenarios were used representing idealized free and constrained loading conditions in axial (body-anterior) and lateral directions. Characteristic rib stiffness and maximum stress location were tracked as simulation output measures. Regression models of rib stiffness found that all shape model parameters added information when predicting stiffness under each loading condition, with their linear combination able to account for 95% of the population stiffness variation due to shape in midlevel ribs for free axial loading, and 92%-98% in other conditions. Full regression models including interactive terms explained up to 99% of population variability.

Regression analyses were conducted to investigate fracture outcomes considering risk factors including vehicle, demographics, and morphomics. The rib fractures of belted occupants were mainly located under the path of the shoulder belt. For the older group, fracture patterns tended to be located in the anterior region but also bilaterally.

Subcutaneous fat thickness was measured with a novel automated technique. Regression analysis was used to determine associations between risk factors and fat thickness with surgical site infection.

Bivariate analysis showed a significant association between surgical site infection and body mass index (P&#61;.01), obesity (P&#61;.02), and fat thickness (P&#61;.002). With multivariate analysis, body mass index and obesity did not show significance, but fat thickness remained significant (P&#61;.026). For every 1-mm thickness of subcutaneous fat there was a 6&#37; (odds ratio, 1.06&#59; 95&#37; confidence interval, 1.02-1.10) increase in the odds of surgical site infection, and patients with fat thickness of greater than 50 mm had a 4-fold increase in the odds of surgical site infection compared with those with fat thickness of less than 50 mm.

This cohort has a 20&#37; one-year mortality rate, yet there are limited data predicting post-fracture survival. Core muscle size, a proxy measure of patient frailty, may be one such variable to help risk stratify patients. METHODS We identified 405 patients undergoing non-operative management of a pelvic fracture who had a CT scan of their abdomen/pelvis within 90 days of fracture. We selected for fragility fractures by including females over 50 and males over 65, with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) less than 18. Core muscle size (cross-sectional area of the psoas muscles at L4, normalized to height) was correlated to post-fracture mortality. RESULTS One-hundred and three patients met our selection criteria (82.5&#37; female). Twenty-four patients died within one year of their diagnosis (23.3&#37;).

Analytic morphomics, a novel process to measure body composition using computational image-processing algorithms, may offer further prognostic information. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model for HCC patients using body composition features and objective clinical information. METHODS Using computed tomography scans from a cohort of HCC patients at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System between January 2006 and December 2013, we developed a prognostic model using analytic morphomics and routine clinical data based on multivariate Cox regression and regularization methods. We assessed model performance using C-statistics and validated predicted survival probabilities. We validated model performance in an external cohort of HCC patients from Parkland Hospital, a safety-net health system in Dallas County. RESULTS The derivation cohort consisted of 204 HCC patients (20.1&#37; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification (BCLC) 0/A), and the validation cohort had 225 patients (22.2&#37; BCLC 0/A). The analytic morphomics model had good prognostic accuracy in the derivation cohort (C-statistic 0.80, 95&#37; confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.89) and external validation cohort (C-statistic 0.75, 95&#37; CI 0.68-0.82).

OBJECTIVES In this context, we evaluated for associations between psoas muscle area and short-term convalescence following radical cystectomy. METHODS After identifying patients who underwent radical cystectomy at our institution (2008 to 2013), we calculated their psoas muscle area from staging computed tomography scans using established analytic morphomic techniques. We then determined early recovery among patients with high and low psoas muscle area using the validated Convalescence and Recovery Evaluation (CARE) questionnaire-a 27-item survey, divided into four domains (activity, cognitive, gastrointestinal, and pain recovery). Finally, we assessed the relationship between psoas muscle area and changes in CARE scores with nested linear regression models. RESULTS Among the 86 men and among 31 women in our cohort, the median total psoas muscle area was 2,544 mm<sup>2</sup> and 1,511 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (P &#60;  0.001 for the comparison). While there was no association between psoas muscle area and recovery in men, women with higher (versus lower) total psoas muscle area had smaller decreases in their pain scores postoperatively and a quicker return to their baseline level (P &#61; 0.05). Activity scores also approached baseline levels faster among women with higher psoas muscle area, although this finding did not reach statistical significance.

Studies are currently retrospective in nature&#59; therefore, it would be beneficial to develop animal models for well-controlled, prospective studies. The aim of this study is to develop an in vivo microCT protocaol for the longitudinal acquisition of whole-body images suitable for morphomic analyses of bone. METHODS The authors performed phantom studies on 2 microCT systems (Inveon and CT120) to study tissue radiodensity and further characterize system performance for collecting animal data. The authors also describe their design of a phantom-immobilization device using phantoms and an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse. RESULTS The authors discovered increased consistency along the z-axis for scans acquired on the Inveon compared with CT120, and calibration by individual slice reduces variability. Objects in the field of view had more impact on measurement acquired using the CT120 compared with the Inveon. The authors also found that using the middle 80&#37; of slices for data analysis further decreased variability, on both systems. Moreover, bone-mineral-density calibration using the QCT Pro Mini phantom improved bone-mineral-density estimates across energy spectra, which helped confirm our technique. Comparison of weekly body weights and terminal uterine mass between sham and OVX groups validated our model.

METHODS Fifty patients who underwent CRT were selected for body composition analyses by either availability of pre/post treatment DEXA scans or a novel CT-based approach of body morphomics analysis (BMA). BMA changes (lean psoas and total psoas area) were compared to total lean body mass changes by DEXA scans using two-sample t tests. Pearson correlation was used to compare the BMA measures to head and neck specific quality of life outcomes. Cox hazards model was used to predict mortality and tumor recurrence. RESULTS Clinically significant declines in total psoas area and lean body mass of similar magnitude were observed in both BMA and DEXA cohorts after CRT. Loss of psoas area (P &#60; 0.05) was associated with greater frailty and mobility issues (3 out of 15 UWQ)L domains). Total psoas area is more sensitive for local recurrence than weight changes and T-stage on multivariate analyses.

METHODS The study cohort comprised 295 patients who underwent either SAVR (n &#61; 156) or TAVR (n &#61; 139). The mean preoperative Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score was 4.7&#37;. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were used to calculate gender-standardized total psoas area (TPA), as a validated measure of sarcopenia. RESULTS For the entire cohort, independent predictors of a composite measure of 30-day death, stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and deep wound infection included preoperative STS major morbidity and mortality risk score (odds ratio [OR], 91.1&#59; P &#61; .02) and TPA (OR, 0.5&#59; P &#61; .024). Two-year survival was 85.7&#37; in patients with sarcopenia, compared with 93.8&#37; in patients without sarcopenia (P &#61; .02). Independent predictors of late survival included TPA (hazard ratio, 0.47&#59; P &#61; .02).

CONCLUSIONS CT scan-derived measurement of TPA as an objective frailty assessment tool predicts early morbidity and mortality, high resource utilization, and late survival after treatment for aortic stenosis.

Prognosis of HCC remains poor, driven by advanced tumor burden at diagnosis in two-thirds of cases. Cancer staging systems are important for prognostication and determination of therapy. HCC has unique characteristics for which it is more difficult to use standard cancer staging strategies. First, there is enormous heterogeneity with regard to patient characteristics and HCC biology. Second, in the Western world, the majority of HCC occurs in patients with significant underlying liver disease, making liver function and functional status important in determining outcome. Lastly, tissue diagnosis is not often required, and radiological diagnosis is often the standard. Various staging systems (Table 1) have been proposed to incorporate these variables, but there is no universal worldwide consensus. Two of these staging systems [Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and Groupe d&#39;ETUDE et de Traitement du Carcinome Hepatocellulaire (GRETCH)] include performance status, with the BCLC being validated in various geographical settings and with very large data sets. As a result, the BCLC staging system is the most accepted system in the United States, having received the endorsement of both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of Liver diseases (Figure 1).

Failure to rescue (FTR) has been shown to be a primary driver of mortality following major general and vascular surgery. We hypothesized that FTR is common in sarcopenic liver transplant recipients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 348 liver transplant recipients with perioperative CT scans. Analytic morphomic techniques were used to assess trunk muscle size via total psoas area (TPA). One-yr major complication and FTR rates were calculated across TPA tertiles. RESULTS The one-yr complication rate was 77&#37; and the FTR rate was 19&#37;. Multivariate regression showed TPA as a significant predictor of FTR (OR &#61; 0.27 per 1000 mm(2) increase in TPA, p &#60; 0.001). Compared to patients in the largest muscle tertile, patients in the smallest tertile had 1.4-fold higher adjusted complication rates (91&#37; vs. 66&#37;) and 2.8-fold higher adjusted FTR rates (22&#37; vs. 8&#37;).

Sarcopenia, defined by gender-stratified tertiles of lean psoas area, was determined from preoperative computed tomography scans using validated analytic morphomics. Data were analyzed to assess sarcopenia&#39;s relationship to costs, readmissions, discharge location, intensive care unit admissions, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Multivariate models were adjusted for patient demographics and surgical risk factors. RESULTS Sarcopenia was independently associated with increased adjusted costs at 30, 90, and 180 but not 365 d.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed morphologic features of acetabula from a consecutive series of trauma-protocol computed tomography scans of patients without pelvis injury. An automated algorithm determined the acetabular rim profile and center of the femoral head, normalized the frontal plane of the pelvis, and calculated version and coverage.

All available CT scans had been performed as part of the patient\'s routine work-up and were not ordered for morphomic analysis. We describe the correlation among temporalis fat pad volume (TFPV), mean zygomatic arch thickness, and incidence of postoperative complications. RESULTS We noted significant difference in the zygomatic bone thickness and TFPV between patients who had medical complications, surgical complications, or total major complications and those who did not. Furthermore, by use of binary logistic regression, our data suggest decreased TFPV and zygomatic arch thickness are stronger predictors of developing postoperative complications than previously studies preoperative characteristics. CONCLUSIONS We describe morphomic analysis of the temporalis region in patients undergoing MHNCS to identify patients at risk for complications. Regional anatomic morphology may serve as a marker to objectively determine a patient&#39;s overall health. Use of the temporalis region is appropriate in patients undergoing MHNCS because of the availability of preoperative scans as part of routine work up for head and/or neck cancer.',26,'Rinkinen J','Levi B'),('Visceral adiposity is negatively associated with bone density and muscle attenuation',2015,'February',NULL,'Am J Clin Nutr. 2015 Feb&#59;101(2)&#58;337-43. doi&#58; 10.3945/ajcn.113.081778.

Despite ample evidence to confirm that increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) deposition occurs with obesity, the interrelations between altered fat partitioning and regional muscle and bone quality are less well understood. OBJECTIVE We examined the association between adiposity and spinal muscle and bone quality across a large, heterogeneous cohort of adults. DESIGN We identified 8833 thoracic or abdominal computed tomography scans from patients in the University of Michigan Health System who were aged 18-64.9 y. We measured trabecular bone densities, cortical bone densities, VAT areas, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas at vertebral levels T7 to L5. Psoas muscle attenuation (an indicator of fat infiltration in muscle) was measured at the L4 level. RESULTS Muscle attenuation as well as trabecular and cortical bone densities revealed negative correlations with BMI, SAT, and VAT. The correlation between BMI and psoas attenuation was -0.321, between BMI and the density of cortical bone was -0.250, and between BMI and trabecular bone was -0.143 (all P &#60; 0.001). However, correlations between VAT and lower muscle attenuation were stronger as were those between VAT and lower bone densities. Inverse correlations between VAT and densities of psoas muscle and cortical and trabecular bone were -0.460, -0.407, and -0.434, respectively (P &#60; 0.001). Even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, partial correlations between VAT, muscle attenuation, and bone densities remained significant at -0.250, -0.119, and -0.216, respectively (P &#60; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Contrary to previous reports that high body mass is associated with increased bone quality, our data show a significant negative association between BMI and muscle and bone densities, suggesting fat infiltration into these tissues.

Analytic morphomics uses computational image processing algorithms to provide precise and detailed measurements of organs and body tissues. We investigated whether morphomic parameters can be used to identify patients with cirrhosis. METHODS In a retrospective study, we performed analytic morphomics on data collected from 357 patients evaluated at the University of Michigan from 2004 to 2012 who had a liver biopsy within 6 months of a computed tomography scan for any reason. We used logistic regression with elastic net regularization and cross-validation to develop predictive models for cirrhosis, within 80&#37; randomly selected internal training set. The other 20&#37; data were used as internal test set to ensure that model overfitting did not occur. In validation studies, we tested the performance of our models on an external cohort of patients from a different health system. RESULTS Our predictive models, which were based on analytic morphomics and demographics (morphomics model) or analytic morphomics, demographics, and laboratory studies (full model), identified patients with cirrhosis with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.91 and 0.90, respectively, compared with 0.69, 0.77, and 0.76 for aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio, Lok Score, and FIB-4, respectively, by using the same data set. In the validation set, our morphomics model identified patients who developed cirrhosis with AUROC value of 0.97, and the full model identified them with AUROC value of 0.90.

We hypothesized that a lower osteogenicity of MSCs would be associated with blunted HO formation in old compared with young mice. In vitro osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived MSCs from old (18-20 months) and young (6-8 weeks) C57/BL6 mice was assessed, with or without preceding burn injury. In vivo studies were then performed using an Achilles tenotomy with concurrent burn injury HO model. HO formation was quantified using &#181;CT scans, Raman spectroscopy, and histology. MSCs from young mice had more in vitro bone formation, upregulation of bone formation pathways, and higher activation of Smad and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) signaling following burn injury. This effect was absent or blunted in cells from old mice. In young mice, burn injury significantly increased HO formation, NF-&#954;B activation, and osteoclast activity at the tenotomy site. This blunted, reactive osteogenic response in old mice follows trends seen clinically and may be related to differences in the ability to mount acute inflammatory responses.

Risk of cardiovascular complications is often difficult to predict using only injury severity and vital signs upon presentation to the trauma center. The utility of analytic morphomics have previously been established in perioperative risk assessment and may provide improved clinical insight in the trauma setting. We hypothesized that morphomic factors may serve as significant predictors of in-hospital cardiac complications for patients involved in MVCs. METHODS Our study included 3,187 MVC adult patients admitted to the University of Michigan Health System who underwent an abdominal CT scan near the time of injury. Exclusion criteria include ISS less than 5 or head-and-neck AIS of 5 or greater. Morphomic factors were measured at the L4 vertebral level using established algorithms. We utilized univariate analysis to determine the relationship of patient demographics, comorbidities, morphomics, and vital signs upon hospital admission with the development of cardiac complications, defined as myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and other cardiac events. Injury severity was stratified by mild (5&#60;ISS&#60;16), moderate (16&#60;ISS&#60;25), and severe (ISS&#62;25) trauma. RESULTS Of the 3,187 eligible patients in our study, 121 (3.8&#37;) developed cardiovascular complications. CVA and MI history, bone mineral density, and BMI were significant predictors of cardiovascular events (p&#60;0.05) in mild trauma. Decreased average psoas radiodensity and increased age were found to be significant predictors for cardiovascular events (p&#60;0.01) in moderate trauma. Glasgow Coma Scale and increased anterior body depth were the two most significant predictors of cardiovascular events in severe trauma (p&#60;0.05). Table 1 shows the results of the univariate analysis between the complications and non- complications group for all three levels of trauma. Non-significant predictors of cardiovascular complications across all trauma levels include gender (p&#61;0.17, 1.0, 0.11) and history of diabetes (p&#61;0.37, 0.65, 0.19) or hypertension (p&#61;0.50, 0.07, 0.35).

Thus, we hypothesized that individualized morphomic factors would be significantly associated with AKI after major general surgery procedures. METHODS 326 adult patients undergoing major, elective, intra-abdominal general surgery operations from January 2008 to September 2011 were selected. Exclusion criteria include patients undergoing isolated appendectomy or cholecystectomy procedures, patients with a preoperative creatinine value of 1.6 or greater, a history of ESRD, or a prior nephrectomy. Preoperative CT scans within 365 days prior to the operation were analyzed for kidney, vertebral, and fascia-associated parameters such as length, area, volume, and radiodensity. Demographic factors include patient age, gender, and BMI. Univariate analysis was utilized to determine the strength of the association between patient morphomic and demographic factors and development of postoperative AKI as defined by the KDIGO criteria within 30 days of the surgery.

Prolonged hospital stay, cost, and mortality have been shown to be increased in these patients and those requiring renal replacement therapy have an even higher mortality rate. In the setting of colon surgery, a recent large scale study found several associated factors with postoperative AKI including advanced age, chronic renal failure, and total colectomy. However, a surgical decision informed by standard clinical data alone may not be sufficient. We set out to study the relationship between AKI and quantitative kidney morphomic factors from cross-sectional preoperative imaging for patients undergoing colectomies and comparing the results with demographic and intra-operative data. We hypothesized that individualized kidney characteristics would correlate with the risk of postoperative AKI development. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively gathered data from adult patients undergoing colectomies from 2006-2012 at the University of Michigan was conducted. 390 initial subjects without elevated baseline creatinine values, ESRD, a prior nephrectomy, or renal injury were included. Polycystic kidneys or other kidney abnormalities identified on imaging were excluded resulting in 326 subjects. AKI was defined by the KDIGO criteria within 30 days of injury. Demographic and intraoperative factors were evaluated along with measurements of pertinent kidney morphomic data including volume, surface area, and average Hounsfield Units (HU) which were subjected to univariate analyses. RESULTS Of the 326 patients, 60 developed AKI (18.4&#37;). Of demographic factors, advanced age (p&#61;0.0002) and a higher BMI (p&#61;0.02) were associated with AKI. Comorbidities associated with AKI included hypertension (p&#61;0.008) and diabetes (p&#61;0.013).

Table 1 shows the results of the univariate analysis of the morphomic factors. CONCLUSION AKI is a serious complication and the prevalence after colorectal surgery at our institution was 18.4&#37;. Our analysis shows that a lower average parenchymal HU was the most significant morphomic factor associated with postoperative AKI.

We hypothesize that trunk muscle size will show dynamic changes over the perioperative period, and this change correlates with postoperative mortality risk. METHODS A total of 425 patients who underwent inpatient general surgery were identified to have both a 90-d preoperative and a 90-d postoperative abdominal computed tomography scan. The change in trunk muscle size was calculated using analytic morphomic techniques. The primary outcome was 1-y survival. Covariate-adjusted outcomes were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 82.6&#37; patients (n &#61; 351) experienced a decrease in trunk muscle size in the time between their scans (average 62.1 d). When stratifying patients into tertiles of rate of change in trunk muscle size and adjusting for other covariates, patients in the tertile of the greatest rate loss had significantly increased risk of 1-y mortality than those in the tertile of the least rate loss (P &#61; 0.002&#59; odds ratio &#61; 3.40 95&#37; confidence interval, 1.55-7.47). The adjusted mortality rate for the tertile of the greatest rate loss was 24.0&#37; compared with 13.3&#37; for the tertile of the least decrease. CONCLUSIONS Trunk muscle size changes rapidly in the perioperative period and correlates with mortality. Trunk muscle size may be a critical target for interventional programs focusing on perioperative optimization of the surgical patient.',41,'Zarinsefat A','Englesbe MJ'),('Abdominal wall dynamics after component separation hernia repair',2014,'August',NULL,'J Surg Res. 2014 Aug&#59;193(1)&#58;497-503. doi&#58; 10.1016/j.jss.2014.08.008. Epub 2014 Aug 9.','https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25201576','BACKGROUND The component separation technique (CST) is an important technique now used frequently in complex ventral hernia repair (VHR). Although this technique has demonstrated superior success rates, there is a paucity of research describing how release of the external obliques coupled with rectus myofascial advancement alters the morphology of the abdominal architecture. In this study, we apply the new concept of analytic morphomics to describe the immediate changes in morphology of the abdomen that take place after VHR by CST. METHODS We identified 21 patients who underwent VHR by CST and received both preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans between 2004 and 2009 in our clinical database. The surgical technique involved incisional release of the external oblique muscle lateral to the linea semilunaris with rectus abdominis myofascial advancement in all patients. Using semiautomated morphomic analysis, we measured the pre- and post-operative dimensions of the abdominal wall including the anterior-posterior distance from the anterior vertebra-to-skin and fascia along with the circumferential area of the skin and fascial compartments. Paired Student t-tests were used to compare pre- and post-operative values. RESULTS After hernia repair, there was a decrease in the anterior vertebra-to-skin distance (16.6 cm-15.8 cm, P &#61; 0.007). There were also decreases in total body area (968.0 cm(2)-928.6 cm(2), P &#61; 0.017) and total body circumference (113.6 cm-111.4 cm, P &#61; 0.016). The distance from fascia to skin decreased as well, almost to the point of statistical significance (3.3 cm-2.9 cm, P &#61; 0.0505). Interestingly, fascia area and circumference did not decrease significantly after the operation (578.2 cm(2)-572.5 cm(2), P &#61; 0.519, and 89.1 cm-88.6 cm, P &#61; 0.394, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Morphomic analysis can be used to compare and pre- and post-operative changes in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Our study demonstrates that component separation affects the dimensions of the entire abdomen, but leaves the fascia area and circumference relatively unchanged. These changes in the abdominal wall may help explain the muscular changes observed as a result of this operation and demonstrate that this is a functional operation that restores fascial area. By better defining the effects of this procedure, we can better understand the reason for its clinical success.',42,'Lisiecki J','Levi B'),('Transsacral screw safe zone size by sacral segmentation variations',2014,'June',NULL,'J Orthop Res. 2014 June 30&#59;33(2)&#58;277-82. doi&#58; 10.1002/jor.22739.

Ten millimeters was used as the safety threshold for a large screw. 3 (0.6&#37;), 366 (70&#37;), and 157 (30&#37;) sacra had 3, 4, or 5 neuroforamen, respectively.

METHODS Computed tomography (CT) scans of 750 patients were selected from the University of Michigan trauma database&59; 314 were children and 436 were adults. Four variables were obtained&#58; the maximum spinal canal radius, vertebral body depth, facet angles, and retroversion angles. RESULTS The cervical spine measurements varied with age and gender. The body depth increased nonlinearly with age. The average vertebral body depth at C4 was 9.2 &#177; 0.38 mm in the 0-3 age group, 15.7 &#177; 0.29 mm in the 18-29 age group, and 17.2 &#177; 0.46 mm in the 60&#43; age group. Pediatric and adult males had larger vertebral body depth than females overall, irrespective of vertebral level (P &#60;.001). Compared to females, the vertebral body depth was 8-9 percent greater in male children and 13-16 percent greater in adult males. The average radius varied with gender, with male children generally having a larger radius than females irrespective of vertebral level (P &#60;.001). Overall, spinal canal radius was smallest in the 0-3 and 60&#43; age groups and largest in the 18-29 age group. The C4 radius was 5.91 &#177; 0.17, 6.28 &#177; 0.14, and 6.73 &#177; 0.17 mm respectively. The radius was larger in the 4-7 age group than in the 0-3 age group, irrespective of vertebral level (P &#60;.0001). There were nonsignificant radius changes between the 4-7 and 8-11 age groups and the 8-11 and age 12-17 groups, suggesting that the size of the spinal cord reaches near maturation by the age of 7. Facet angles decreased with age in children and increased with age in adults. The average facet angles were largest in the 0-3 age group (P &#60;.1, C2-C6). Adult facet angles were greater in the 60&#43; age group than in the 18-29 age group (P &#60;.0001, C2-C6). Males had larger facet angles than females overall (P &#60;.01 at C2, C5-C7). The retroversion angles were largest at C6 and C7. They increased with age in children and decreased in the adult population&#59; they were larger (5-22&#37;) in the 18-29 age group than in the 60&#43; age group (P &#60;.0001, C2-C6). CONCLUSIONS The results obtained in this study help explain variations in cervical anatomical changes associated with age and gender. The information is useful when assessing differences in injury patterns between different segments of the population.

The authors hypothesized that tissue morphology measurements (morphomics) of preoperative computed tomography scans stratify the risk of surgical site infection in patients undergoing ventral hernia repair with a component separation technique. METHODS The authors identified 93 patients who underwent component release ventral hernia repair (2004 to 2012). The surgical technique involved release of the external oblique muscle lateral to the linea semilunaris. Using analytic morphomic techniques, the authors measured patients&#39; morphology using routine preoperative computed tomography scans. Two-sample t test was used to evaluate the effect of morphomic and demographic factors on surgical-site infection. Separate logistic regression analyses were performed on these morphomic factors to evaluate their predictive value in assessing the risk of surgical site infection, controlling for demographic covariates. RESULTS Surgical site infections were observed in 31 percent (n &#61; 29) of the population. Subcutaneous fat area, total body area, and total body circumference had increased odds ratios for surgical site infection (p &#61; 0.004, 0.014, and 0.012, respectively), indicating that these measures are better associated with surgical site infection than body mass index. These calculations control for demographic covariates, confirming that these morphomic parameters are predictive of surgical site infection. CONCLUSION Specific morphomic values serve as superior predictors of surgical site infection in patients undergoing component separation technique hernia repair than currently used values such as body mass index.

However, a gap exists in translating this knowledge to bedside decision making. We introduced a novel measure of patient-centered surgical risk assessment&#58; morphometric age. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between morphometric age and posttransplant survival. DATA SOURCES Medical records of recipients of deceased-donor liver transplants (study population) and kidney donors/trauma patients (morphometric age control population). STUDY SELECTION A retrospective cohort study of 348 liver transplant patients and 3313 control patients. We assessed medical records for validated morphometric characteristics of aging (psoas area, psoas density, and abdominal aortic calcification). We created a model (stratified by sex) for a morphometric age equation, which we then calculated for the control population using multivariate linear regression modeling (covariates). These models were then applied to the study population to determine each patient\'s morphometric age. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS All analytic steps related to measuring morphometric characteristics were obtained via custom algorithms programmed into commercially available software. An independent observer confirmed all algorithm outputs. Trained assistants performed medical record review to obtain patient characteristics. RESULTS Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that morphometric age was a significant independent predictor of overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.03 per morphometric year [95&#37; CI, 1.02-1.04&#59; P &#60; .001]) after liver transplant. Chronologic age was not a significant covariate for survival (hazard ratio, 1.02 per year [95&#37; CI, 0.99-1.04&#59; P &#61; .21]). Morphometric age stratified patients at high and low risk for mortality. For example, patients in the middle chronologic age tertile who jumped to the oldest morphometric tertile have worse outcomes than those who jumped to the youngest morphometric tertile (74.4&#37; vs 93.2&#37; survival at 1 year [P &#61; .03]; 45.2&#37; vs 75.0&#37; at 5 years [P &#61; .03]).

The accuracy of morphomic analysis on other muscles has not been clearly delineated. In this study, we determine the correlation between temporalis muscle mass, psoas muscle area, age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. METHODS Temporalis and psoas muscle dimensions were determined on all trauma patients who had both abdominal and maxillofacial CT scans at the University of Michigan between 2004 and 2011. Age, BMI, and gender were obtained through chart review. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the relative relationship between morphomic data of the temporalis and psoas muscles and the ability of such information to correspond with clinical variables, such as BMI, age, and gender. RESULTS A total of 646 patients were included in the present study. Among the 249 (38.5&#37;) women and 397 (61.5&#37;) men, the average age was 49.2 y. Average BMI was 27.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Total psoas muscle area directly correlated with mean temporalis muscle thickness (r &#61; 0.57, P &#60; 0.001). There was an indirect correlation between age and psoas muscle area (r &#61; -0.52, P &#60; 0.001) and temporalis muscle thickness (r &#61; -0.36, P &#60; 0.001). Neither psoas nor temporalis measurements correlated strongly with BMI (r &#61; 0.18, P &#60; 0.001; r &#61; 0.14, P &#61; 0.002), although stronger correlations were found in a more &#34;frail,&#34; subgroup as defined by a BMI of &#60;20 (r &#61; 0.59, P &#61; 0.002).

The automotive safety community has been interested in understanding the effect of age on restraint performance. Focus has been placed on characterizing the body&#39;s structural changes associated with age and gender. In this study, spine alignment and torso depth were assessed, because both variables have been shown to affect injury risk. METHODS The data was obtained from computed tomography (CT) scans of more than 24,000 patients aged 16 and older. The data consisted of thoracic and lumbar vertebral angles relative to a fixed plane, as well as vertebra-to-front skin and spine-to-back skin distances. Angle measurements were taken in the sagittal plane at each vertebra level from T1 to L5&#59; distance measurements were taken from T6 to L5. The data were analyzed as a function of gender and age with the young group defined as 16 to 29 years old and the older group as 75 and up. RESULTS Vertebral angles were different depending on location. They varied from -24.5 &#177; 8.9&#176; at T2 to 12.2 &#177; 5.6&#176; at L1. The vertebral angles also varied with age. Angles in the older male group were 1.74 times larger at T1 and 2.03 times larger at T7 than in the young male group. Similar findings were observed for females. The effect of age and gender was modeled with forward/backward selection using a regression model. The vertebra-to-front skin distance also differed depending on vertebral level. It was highest at T10 at 162.5 &#177; 30.9 mm and lowest at L4 at 125.3 &#177; 37.3 mm for the entire study population. On average, males had larger distances than females. The spine-to-back distances were greatest in the lumbar area. The spine-to-back distance increased with lower vertebral level, regardless of age. The vertebral angle and distance data were analyzed for a male subgroup approximating the height and weight of a 50<sup>th</sup> percentile male dummy. The results showed that the vertebra-to-front skin distance increased with age. There was not a clear trend for the spine-to-back skin distance and L1 vertebral angle. CONCLUSIONS The changes in the vertebral angles, as well as the anterior and posterior spine-to-skin distances along the sagittal plane, were determined as a function of age and gender. The effect was greatest in the mid-thoracic area. Spine alignment and body shape differences need to be considered in human mathematical models used to develop safety countermeasures for the older population, because they may affect the loading path and lead to different seating postures or belt positioning.

In this study, the liver anatomy was quantified in both adult and pediatric populations as a function of gender and age. Five anatomical liver measurements were determined using CT scans of 260 normal livers. These measurements include the area and volume, and the length, width, and girth of the liver (IRB HUM00041441). To characterize geometrical shape, an inscribed sphere and circumscribed ellipsoid were fitted on the measurements. In the pediatric population the liver area and volume continuously increased with age. When normalized by patient weight, volume measurements show a decrease in volume with age, suggesting that the liver occupies a smaller proportion of the body with age. In the adult population, liver measurements varied with gender. The superior and inferior locations of the liver were also recorded with respect to the spine. The lower portion was at the L3 in small children and at L2 as children approached puberty. It stayed in that area through the 60&#43; group, offering more ribcage protection. Liver injury patterns were also assessed in crash occupants. Seventy-two occupants with moderate to severe (AIS 2&#43;) liver injuries were investigated. A new methodology was presented and consisted of quantifying blood volumes. The results were compared to overall liver volume and injury scales.

The effectiveness of this methodology was illustrated through analysis of occupant chest injuries in frontal vehicle crashes. The crash data were obtained from the International Center for Automotive Medicine (ICAM) database for calendar year 1996 to 2012. The morphomic data are quantitative measurements of variations in human body 3-dimensional anatomy. Morphomics are obtained from imaging records. In this study, morphomics were obtained from chest, abdomen, and spine CT using novel patented algorithms. A NASS-trained crash investigator with over thirty years of experience collected the in-depth crash data. There were 226 cases available with occupants involved in frontal crashes and morphomic measurements. Only cases with complete recorded data were retained for statistical analysis. Logistic regression models were fitted using all possible configurations of vehicle, demographic, and morphomic variables. Different models were ranked by the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). An averaged logistic regression model approach was used due to the limited sample size relative to the number of variables. This approach is helpful when addressing variable selection, building prediction models, and assessing the importance of individual variables. The final predictive results were developed using this approach, based on the top 100 models in the AIC ranking. Model-averaging minimized model uncertainty, decreased the overall prediction variance, and provided an approach to evaluating the importance of individual variables. There were 17 variables investigated&#58; four vehicle, four demographic, and nine morphomic. More than 130,000 logistic models were investigated in total. The models were characterized into four scenarios to assess individual variable contribution to injury risk. Scenario 1 used vehicle variables&#59; Scenario 2, vehicle and demographic variables&#59; Scenario 3, vehicle and morphomic variables&#59; and Scenario 4 used all variables. AIC was used to rank the models and to address over-fitting. In each scenario, the results based on the top three models and the averages of the top 100 models were presented. The AIC and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were reported in each model. The models were re-fitted after removing each variable one at a time. The increases of AIC and the decreases of AUC were then assessed to measure the contribution and importance of the individual variables in each model. The importance of the individual variables was also determined by their weighted frequencies of appearance in the top 100 selected models. Overall, the AUC was 0.58 in Scenario 1, 0.78 in Scenario 2, 0.76 in Scenario 3 and 0.82 in Scenario 4. The results showed that morphomic variables are as accurate at predicting injury risk as demographic variables. The results of this study emphasize the importance of including morphomic variables when assessing injury risk. The results also highlight the need for morphomic data in the development of human mathematical models when assessing restraint performance in frontal crashes, since morphomic variables are more &#34;tangible&#34; measurements compared to demographic variables such as age and gender.',51,'Zhang P','Wang SC'),('Cost of major surgery in the sarcopenic patient',2013,'November',NULL,'J Am Coll Surg. 2013 Nov&#59;217(5)&#58;813-8. doi&#58; 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.04.042.

There are currently no data regarding the financial implications of providing care for these high-risk patients. STUDY DESIGN We identified 1,593 patients within the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) who underwent elective major general or vascular surgery at a single institution between 2006 and 2011. Patient sarcopenia, determined by lean psoas area (LPA), was derived from preoperative CT scans using validated analytic morphomic methods. Financial data including hospital revenue and direct costs were acquired for each patient through the hospital&#39;s finance department. Financial data were adjusted for patient and procedural factors using multiple linear regression methods, and Mann-Whitney U test was used for significance testing. RESULTS After controlling for patient and procedural factors, decreasing LPA was independently associated with increasing payer costs (&#36;6,989.17 per 1,000 mm(2) LPA, p &#60; 0.001). The influence of LPA on payer costs increased to &#36;26,988.41 per 1,000 mm(2) decrease in LPA (p &#60; 0.001) in patients who experienced a postoperative complication. Further, the covariate-adjusted hospital margin decreased by &#36;2,620 per 1,000 mm(2) decrease in LPA (p &#60; 0.001) such that average negative margins were observed in the third of patients with the smallest LPA. CONCLUSIONS Sarcopenia is associated with high payer costs and negative margins after major surgery. Although postoperative complications are universally expensive to payers and providers, sarcopenic patients represent a uniquely costly patient demographic.

In this study, abdominal injuries for occupants involved in frontal impacts were assessed using crash and medical data. METHODS Injury rates and patterns were first assessed with respect to thoracic injuries. A statistical analysis was then conducted to predict abdominal injury outcome using 18 covariate variables, including 4 vehicle, 4 demographic, and 10 morphomic, derived from computed tomography (CT) scans. More than 260,000 logistic regression models were fitted using all possible variable combinations. The models were ranked using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and combined through the model-averaging approach to produce the optimal predictive model. The performance of the models was then assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS The rate of serious thoracic injury was 2.49 times higher than the rate of abdominal injury. The associated odds ratio was 2.31 (P &#60;.01). These results suggest a strong association between serious abdominal and thoracic injuries. The optimal model AUC was 0.646 when using solely vehicle data, 0.696 when combining vehicle and demographic data, 0.866 when combining vehicle and morphomic data, and 0.879 when combining vehicle, demographic, and morphomic data. These results suggest that morphomic variables better predict abdominal injury outcomes than demographic variables. The most important morphomics variables included visceral fat area, trabecular bone density, and spine angulation.

This study evaluated the relationship between core muscle size and patient outcomes following esophagectomy for malignancy. Using preoperative computed tomography scans in 230 subjects who had undergone transhiatal esophagectomy for cancer between 2001 and 2010, lean psoas area (LPA), measured at the fourth lumbar vertebra, was determined. Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to analyze overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) adjusted for age, gender, and stage, and the Akaike information criterion was used to determine each covariate contribution to OS and DFS. Univariate analysis demonstrated that increasing LPA correlated with both OS (P &#61; 0.017) and DFS (P &#61; 0.038). In multivariate analysis controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, LPA correlated with OS and DFS in patients who had not received neoadjuvant treatment (n &#61; 64), with higher LPA associated with improved OS and DFS. Moreover, LPA was of equivalent, or slightly higher importance than pathologic stage. These measures were not predictive among patients (n &#61; 166) receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

Currently, no risk model has been developed to determine the likelihood of needing a blood transfusion. The authors propose an objective model, based on patients&#39; three-dimensional anatomical characteristics, to stratify the likelihood of needing perioperative packed red blood cells. METHODS High-throughput image analysis from already ordered preoperative computed tomographic scans was used to reconstruct the three-dimensional anatomy of the temporalis muscle and overlying temporal fat pad. Using these morphomic measurements, the authors created a risk assessment model of the amount of packed red blood cells infused based on morphomic variations in temporal soft tissue. RESULTS The authors evaluated 139 infants with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis from the University of Michigan Health System. Results show the need for blood transfusion ranged from 94.1 percent among patients in the smallest quartile for temporal fat pad volume compared with 65.7 percent among the group with the largest quartile for temporal fat pad volume (p &#61; 0.0057). Using multivariable linear regression, temporal fat pad volume (p &#61; 0.012) and fat pad thickness (p &#61; 0.036) were independent predictors for amount of packed red blood cells required. CONCLUSIONS The authors demonstrate that patients with diminished temporal fat pad volume are significantly more likely to need increased packed red blood cell transfusions.

Physicians describe &#34;temporalis wasting&#34; as a finding that indicates frailty&#59; however, this is a subjective finding without quantitative values. In this study, we demonstrate that decreased morphomic values of the temporalis muscle and zygomatic bone are an objective measure of frailty associated with increased injury-induced morbidity as well as negative impact on overall hospital-based clinical outcomes in patients with mandible fracture. METHODS Computed tomographic (CT) scans from all patients with a diagnosis of a mandible fracture in the University of Michigan trauma registry and with a hospital admission were collected from the years 2004 to 2011. Automated, high-throughput CT analysis was used to reconstruct the anatomy and quantify morphomic values (temporalis volume, area and thickness, and zygomatic thickness) in these patients using MATLAB v13.0 (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). Subsequently, a subset of 16 individuals with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14 or 15 was analyzed to control for brain injury. Clinical data were obtained, and the association between morphomic measurements and clinical outcomes was evaluated using Pearson correlation for unadjusted analysis and multiple regression for adjusted analysis. RESULTS The mean age of patients in the study was 47.1 years. Unadjusted analysis using Pearson correlation revealed that decreases in zygomatic bone thickness correlated strongly with increases in hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator days (P &#60; 0.0001, P &#61; 0.0003, and P &#60; 0.0017, respectively). Furthermore, we found that decreases in temporalis mean thickness correlated with increases in hospital and ventilator days (P &#61; 0.0264 and P &#61; 0.0306, respectively). Similarly, decreases in temporalis local mean thickness are significantly correlated with increases in hospital and ventilator days (P &#61; 0.0232 and P &#61; 0.0472, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Decreased thicknesses of the zygomatic bone and temporalis muscle are significantly correlated with higher hospital, ventilator, and intensive care unit days in patients with mandibular fracture receiving reconstructive operations.

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of the electronic medical records and advanced imaging of 1961 patients who underwent pulmonary embolism protocol computed tomography scans between December 1999 and March 2010. The computed tomography scans were imported from the clinical picture archiving and communication system archive into a research image archive and analysis system. Each scan was processed by an automated system that algorithmically determined bony landmarks, adjusted for body position within the scanner and measured the radius of curvature. RESULTS The mean medullary radius of curvature of 3922 femurs was 112 cm (SD &#61; 26 cm). The mean anterior radius of curvature of the femurs was 145 cm (SD &#61; 55 cm). There was a moderately strong positive correlation (0.36-0.39) between femoral length and radius of curvature (P &#60; 0.0001) that was not affected by age, body mass index, cortical thickness, gender, or ethnicity. No significant relationship was found between either gender or ethnicity and radius of curvature independent of femoral length. CONCLUSIONS Differences in radius of curvature based on ethnicity and gender exist primarily because of the variation in average height, and therefore femur length, that exists between ethnic groups and genders.

The mandibular malformations linked with these maladies are closely associated with the form and function of the temporalis muscle. Despite these associations, a paucity of research has been directed at quantifying how these malformations affect the tissues of the temporal region. In this paper, we seek to quantify differences in the temporalis muscle and the temporal fat pad using a novel CT-derived analytic program to examine craniofacial morphomic indices within these patient groups in comparison to normal age-matched controls. We posit that the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad, like other derivatives of the first branchial arch, are hypoplastic in patients with TC and PR compared to age-matched controls. METHODS High-throughput image analysis was used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional (3D) anatomy and quantify morphomic measures of the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad in children with PR, TC, and age-matched controls. These steps were completed in a semi-automated method using algorithms programmed in MATLAB v13.0. The 3D reconstructions were analyzed in 3 children with PR (6 temporal regions), 3 children with TC (6 temporal regions), and a control group of 19 children (38 temporal regions). We also quantified the same measurements in a localized &#34;core&#34; sample in the area of greatest thickness, providing a more consistent sample of the tissue position. Relationships between the temporal muscle and fat pad values and craniofacial abnormality type were assessed using Wilcoxon nonparametric test using exact distribution, with a P value of less than 0.05 being deemed significant. RESULTS The mean age of our patients was 6.0 years in PR and 4.5 years in TC cohorts. We were able to establish an automated methodology to quantify the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad based on CT characteristics. Localized temporalis volume and localized temporalis area were significantly smaller in children with PR than in the control group. Total temporalis fat volume and localized temporalis area were significantly less in children with TC than in the control group. When compared to each other, the PR group had small morphomic values compared to TC group. CONCLUSIONS There are significant morphomic differences in the temporalis muscle and the temporal fat pad in children with either PR or TC when compared to age-matched control group which can be measured from pre-existing CT scans. Specifically, both of these test groups show decreases in the morphomic measures of the temporalis region. The quantification of these changes corroborates and objectifies the clinical findings associated with these congenital deformities while simultaneously allowing for preoperative planning. Furthermore, this finding confirms that the hypoplasia seen in these patient populations is not only hypoplasia of the mandible but also of the surrounding functional matrix, which includes the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad.',62,'Lisiecki J','Levi B'),('The effect of age on fat and bone properties along the vertebral spine',2013,'',NULL,'SAE Int.

The automotive safety community has been interested in understanding the effect of aging on restraint performance. Recent research has been focused on assessing the structural and material changes associated with age. In this study, structural tissue distribution was determined using the computed tomography (CT) scan data of more than 19,000 patients, aged 16 and up. The data consisted of subcutaneous fat cross-sectional area, visceral fat cross-sectional area, and trabecular bone density taken at each vertebral level. The data was quantified as a function of five age groups with the youngest group defined as 16-29 years old and the oldest group as 75 and up. An additional analysis stratified on gender was carried out. Overall, visceral fat increased with age. Compared to the 16-29 group, the visceral fat measured at the L1 level was 1.97 in the 30-44 group, 2.55 in the 45-59 group, 3.33 in the 60-74 group and 3.21 times greater in the 75&#43; group. Subcutaneous fat also increased with age up to the 60-74-year-old group. The subcutaneous fat measured at L1 level was 1.34 in the 30-44 group, 1.39 in the 45-59 group, 1.38 in the 60-74 group and 1.09 times greater in the 75&#43; group than in the 16-29 group. A significant association between trabecular bone density and age was found. Trabecular bone density in Hounsfield units (HU) decreased as a function of age, by 2.57&#42;age &#43;0.0056&#42;age<sub>2</sub> for females and 2.57&#42;age &#43;0.0082&#42;age<sub>2</sub> for males. Gender differences were also observed. Females had 1.43 times more subcutaneous fat and 1.10 times higher trabecular bone density than males at L1, while males had 1.88 times more visceral fat than females. Females gained more subcutaneous fat at L1 as they increased in age up to the 45-59 group and then progressively lost subcutaneous fat. Males and females gained more visceral fat at L1 as they aged up to the 60-74 group. Both consistently lost bone density at L1 as they grew older. The data was also analyzed for a male subgroup approximating the height and weight of a 50<sup>th</sup> percentile male dummy. Visceral fat increased with age while trabecular bone density decreased. There was an overall-trend for an increase in subcutaneous fat with age. The results obtained in this study provide insight on the quantified effect of bone and fat distribution as a function of age, gender, and vertebral level.

Our study evaluated the relationship between abdominal aortic (AA) calcification measured on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging and surgical complications in patients undergoing general elective and vascular surgery. We hypothesized that patients with no known CV risk factors but significant aortic calcification on preoperative imaging will have inferior surgical outcomes. METHODS The study group included 1180 patients from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) database who underwent major general or vascular elective surgery between 2006 and 2009 and who had a CT scan of the abdomen specifically for preoperative planning. AA calcification was measured using novel analytic morphomic techniques and reported as a percentage of the total wall area containing calcification. Patients were divided into cohorts by clinical CV risk and extent of AA calcification. Univariate analysis was used to compare postoperative morbidity between patient cohorts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to compare continuous AA calcification with overall morbidity in patients with no clinical CV risk factors. RESULTS AA calcification was strongly skewed to the right (53.5&#37; had no AA calcification) and was significantly correlated with age (ρ &#61; 0.43, P &#60; 0.001). Unadjusted univariate analysis of morbidity showed no significant differences in complication rates between patients in the clinical CV risk and significant AA calcification (no known CV risk factor) categories. The clinical CV risk (P &#60; 0.001) and significant AA calcification without CV risk factors (P &#61; 0.009) populations both had significantly more infectious and overall complications than patients with no AA calcification and no clinical CV risk. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that AA calcification was a significant predictor of morbidity in patients with no clinical CV risk factors (odds ratio &#61; 1.35, P &#61; 0.017). DISCUSSION This study suggests that AA calcification may be related to progression of CV disease and surgical outcomes.

Our specific aim is to determine the efficacy of craniofacial morphomic indices (CMI) such as temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad morphometric values to predict blood transfusion requirement and hospital stay in a cohort of children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC). METHODS High-throughput, semi-automated image analysis was used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional anatomy of the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad and to quantify CMIs. The prognostic effect of CMI on clinical outcomes were evaluated among all NSC patients and compared across various craniosynostosis subtypes using Wilcoxon nonparametric tests and Kendall\'s τ to determine significance. RESULTS Using preoperative CT images, we evaluated 117 children with NSC from the University of Michigan Health System. Results demonstrate that increased temporal fat pad volume and local temporalis muscle volume are associated with better clinical outcomes in craniosynostosis patients. More specifically, temporal fat pad volume was shown to be a significant predictor of perioperative blood transfusion requirements (P &#61; 0.0033) and increased temporal muscle volume correlated with decreased hospital stay (P &#61; 0.016) when controlling for other covariates including age, sex, weight, and preoperative hematocrit. In addition, the same significant predictors were found when examining individual subtypes of craniosynostosis. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that maxillofacial CT scans provide a useful quantitative index reflecting general patient health, risk stratification, and probabilities of intervention in addition to their previously established ability to determine the specific pathology of the patient.

METHODS The study population included all patients within the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative database with a computerized tomography(CT) scan before major, elective general or vascular surgery (N &#61; 1453). The lean core muscle size was calculated using analytic morphomic techniques. The primary outcome measure was survival, whereas secondary outcomes included surgical complications and costs.

In this study, we posit that novel CT-derived temporal muscle and temporal fat pad morphomics (tissue thickness, area, and volume) can be used to calculate temporal morphomic indices (TMIs), which are unique to each NSC subtype (metopic, coronal, and sagittal) and divergent from normal individuals. METHODS High-throughput image analysis was used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional anatomy and quantify a TMI. These steps were completed in a semiautomated method using algorithms programmed in MATLAB v13.0. Differences in TMI across various craniosynostosis subtypes were assessed using Wilcoxon nonparametric tests for both patients with NSC and a control cohort of patients with trauma. RESULTS Using preoperative CT images, we evaluated 117 children with NSC from the University of Michigan Health System and 50 age-matched control patients between 1999 and 2011. Results indicate significant differences in TMI among the normal and NSC groups, with normal patients having significantly higher TMI values than patients with metopic, sagittal, and coronal synostosis. In addition, significant differences were found to exist between each craniosynostosis category. CONCLUSIONS Patients with craniosynostosis demonstrate diminished temporalis muscle and overlying fat pad volume and thickness compared with control patients. The unique changes in temporal morphomics presented in this article demonstrate not only that the bony calvaria is affected by craniosynostosis but also that there exist quantifiable aberrations in the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad.

Central sarcopenia as part of the cachexia syndrome is a marker of frailty and predicts mortality. This study seeks to confirm that psoas muscle density (PMD), lean psoas muscle area (LPMA), lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI), and intra-abdominal (IA) or subcutaneous fat (SC) can be used in combination to more accurately predict survival in ACC patients. METHODS PMD, LPMA, IA, and SC fat were measured on serial CT scans of patients with ACC. Clinical outcome was correlated with quantitative data from patients with ACC and analyzed. A linear regression model was used to describe the relationship between PMD, LPMA, LSMI, IA, and SC fat, time to recurrence, and length of survival according to tumor stage. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five ACC patients (94 females) were treated from 2005 to 2011. Significant morphometric predictors of survival include PMD, LPMA, and IA fat (p &#8804; 0.0001, &#8804; 0.0024, &#60;0.0001, respectively) and improve prediction of survival compared to using stage alone. A 100-mm(2) increase in LPMA confers an 8&#37; lower hazard of death. LSMI does not change significantly between stages (p &#61; 0.3196). CONCLUSION Decreased PMD, LPMA, and increased IA fat suggest decreased survival in ACC patients and correlate with traditional staging systems.

If the latter were true, then biologic frailty, and not age, should be an independent prognostic factor in melanoma. METHODS Our prospective institutional review board (IRB)-approved database was queried for stage III patients with computed tomography (CT) scans at time of lymph node dissection (LND). Psoas area (PA) and density (PD) were determined in semi-automated fashion. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival estimates and Cox proportional-hazard models were used to determine PA and PD impact on survival and surgical complications. RESULTS Among 101 stage III patients, PD was significantly associated with both disease-free survival (DFS) (P &#61; 0.04) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) (P &#61; 0.0002). Cox multivariate modeling incorporating thickness, age, ulceration, and N stage showed highly significant association with PD and both DFS and DDFS. DDFS was significantly associated with Breslow thickness (P &#61; 0.04), number of positive nodes (P &#61; 0.001), ulceration (P &#61; 0.04), and decreasing muscle density (P &#61; 0.01), with hazard ratio of 0.55 [95&#37; confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.87].

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 105 patients (54 cirrhosis and 51 normal) who had CT scans within 6 months of a liver biopsy or were identified through a Trauma registry were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into the training set (n &#61; 81) and the validation set (n &#61; 24). Each liver was segmented in a semi-automated fashion from a computed tomography scan using Mimics software. The resulting liver surfaces were saved as a stereo lithography mesh into an Oracle database, and analyzed in MATLAB(&#174;) for morphological markers of cirrhosis. RESULTS The best predictive model for diagnosing cirrhosis consisted of liver slice-bounding box slice ratio, the dimensions of the liver bounding box, liver slice area, slice perimeter, surface volume and adjusted surface area. With this model, we calculated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 for the training set, and 0.91 for the validation set. For comparison, we calculated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 for our dataset when we used the lab value based aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index, another reported model for predicting cirrhosis. Last, by combining the aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index and our model, we obtained an area under the receiving operating characteristic of 0.95.

Central sarcopenia is a marker of frailty and predicts mortality. The hypothesis of this study is that central sarcopenia can be used as a marker of disease severity and frailty in patients with HC. METHODS Psoas muscle area and psoas muscle density (PMD) were measured at specific points on CT scans of patients with HC using a defined protocol. We compared 24-hour urine cortisol (24HUC) levels by time point to each CT scan. A linear regression model was used to describe the relationship between 24HUC and morphometric variables. A comparison with matched non-HC patients was performed. RESULTS We identified 45 patients (34 female).

Bilateral measurements were taken on uninjured patients, while only the uninjured side was valuated in those with hip trauma. Multinomial logistic regression found that after controlling for age, height, weight, and gender, each 1 degree decrease in acetabular anteversion angle (AAA) corresponded to an 8 percent increase in fracture likelihood (p&#60;0.001). Age, weight, and gender were found to influence anteversion angle significantly, with each 10 years in age increasing AAA by 1.07 degrees, each 10 kg of weight decreasing AAA by 0.45 degrees, and being female resulting in 1.42 degrees greater AAA than males. Height was not found to relate significantly to AAA after other anthropometric factors were controlled for.

STUDY DESIGN We identified 655 patients who underwent midline laparotomy (2006 to 2009) using the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative database. Using novel, semiautomated analytic morphometric techniques, the thickness of subcutaneous fat along the linea alba was measured between T12 and L4. To adjust for variations in patient size, subcutaneous fat was normalized to the distance between the vertebrae and anterior skin. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors independently associated with the incidence of SSI. RESULTS Overall, SSIs were observed in 12.5&#37; (n &#61; 82) of the population. Logistic regression revealed that patients with increased subcutaneous fat had significantly greater odds of developing a superficial incisional SSI (odds ratio [OR] &#61; 1.76 per 10&#37; increase, 95&#37; CI 1.10 to 2.83, p &#61; 0.019).

The ICAM database is comprised of information from real world crashes in which occupants were seriously injured and required treatment at a Level 1 Trauma Center.

One hundred thirty three (133) case occupants who sustained nearly 1,800 injuries were selected for study from the ICAM database. The study included evaluations of skeletal, organ, and vessel injuries to the upper torso. Potential influencing factors were divided into three general categories&#58; vehicle factors (i.e. seatbelt design)&#59; occupant factors&#59; and crash related factors.

We sought to use core muscle size as an objective measure of frailty, and determine its utility as a predictor of survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. METHODS Four hundred seventy-nine patients underwent elective open AAA repair between 2000 and 2008. Two hundred sixty-two patients (54.7&#37;) had preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans available for analysis. Cross-sectional areas of the psoas muscles at the level of the L4 vertebra were measured. The covariate-adjusted effect of psoas area on postoperative mortality was assessed using Cox regression. RESULTS Of the 262 patients, there were 55 deaths and the mean length of follow-up was 2.3 years. Cox regression revealed a significant association between psoas area and postoperative mortality (P &#61; .003). The effect of psoas area was found to decrease significantly as follow-up time increased (P &#61; .008). Among all covariates included in the Cox models (including predictors of mortality such as American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] score), the psoas area was the most significant.

Triage of pediatric patients to appropriate centers can be based on the crash/injury characteristics. Pediatric motor vehicle crash/injury characteristics can be determined from an in vitro laboratory using child crash dummies. However, to date, no detailed data with respect to outcomes and crash mechanism have been presented with a pediatric in vivo model. METHODS The Crash Injury Research Engineering Network is comprised of 10 level 1 trauma centers. Crashes were examined with regard to age, crash severity (DeltaV), crash direction, restraint use, and airbag deployment. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed with Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) as outcomes. Standard age groupings (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-18) were used. The database is biases toward a survivor population with few fatalities. RESULTS Four hundred sixty-one motor vehicle crashes with 2500 injuries were analyzed (242 boys, 219 girls). Irrespective of age, DeltaV &#62; 30 mph resulted in increased ISS and decreased GCS (eg, for 0-4 years, DeltaV &#60; 30&#58; ISS &#61; 10, GCS &#61; 13.5 vs DeltaV &#62; 30&#58; ISS &#61; 19.5, GCS &#61; 10.6&#59; P &#60; .007, &#60; .002, respectively). Controlling for DeltaV, children in lateral crashes had increased ISS and decreased GCS versus those in frontal crashes. Airbag deployment was protective for children 15 to 18 years old and resulted in a lower ISS and higher GCS (odds ratio, 2.1&#59; 95&#37; confidence interval, 0.9-4.6).

Previous research suggest that children in lateral crashes or front-seat locations have higher Injury Severity Scale scores and lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores than those in frontal-impact crashes. However, specific injury patterns and crash characteristics have not been characterized. METHODS Data were collected from the CIREN multidisciplinary crash reconstruction network (10 pediatric trauma centers). Injuries were examined with regard to crash direction (frontal/lateral), restraint use, seat location, and change in velocity at impact (DeltaV). Injuries were limited to Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores of 3 or higher and included head, thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, spine, and long bone (orthopedic) injuries. Standard age groupings (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-18 years) were used. Statistical analyses used Fisher&#39;s Exact test and multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS Four hundred seventeen MVCs with 2500 injuries were analyzed (males &#61; 219, females &#61; 198). Controlling for DeltaV and age, children in lateral-impact crashes (n &#61; 232) were significantly more likely to suffer severe injuries to the head and thorax as compared with children in frontal crashes (n &#61; 185), who were more likely to suffer severe spine and orthopedic injuries. Children in a front-seat (n &#61; 236) vs those in a back-seat (n &#61; 169) position had more injuries to the thoracic (27&#37; vs 17&#37;), abdominal (21&#37; vs 13&#37;), pelvic (11&#37; vs 1&#37;), and orthopedic (28&#37; vs 10&#37;) regions (P &#60; .05 for all).

These include both morphological (structural) changes (e.g., increased thoracic kyphosis) and material changes (e.g., osteoporosis). The purpose of this study is to evaluate structural changes that occur in the aging bony thorax and to assess the importance of these changes relative to the well-established material changes. The study involved two primary components. First, full-thorax computed tomography (CT) scans of 161 patients, age 18 to 89 years, were analyzed to quantify the angle of the ribs in the sagittal plane. A significant association between the angle of the ribs and age was identified, with the ribs becoming more perpendicular to the spine as age increased (0.08 degrees/year, p&#61;0.012). Next, a finite element model of the thorax was used to evaluate the importance of this rib angle change relative to other factors associated with aging. A three-factor, two-level factorial design was used to assess the relative importance of rib cage morphology (&#34;young&#34; and &#34;old&#34; rib angle), thickness of the cortical shell (thick &#61; &#34;young&#34; and thin &#61; &#34;old&#34;), and the bone material properties (&#34;young&#34; and &#34;old&#34;) on the force-deflection response and injury tolerance of the thorax. The simulations showed that the structural and material changes played approximately equal roles in modulating the force-deflection response of the thorax. Changing the rib angle to be more perpendicular to the spine increased the effective thoracic stiffness, while the &#34;old&#34; material properties and the thin cortical shell decreased the effective stiffness. The offsetting effects of these traits resulted in similar effective thoracic stiffness for the &#34;elderly&#34; and baseline thoracic models, which is consistent with cadaver data available in the literature. All three effects tended to decrease chest deflection tolerance for rib fractures, though the material changes dominated (a four- to six-fold increase in elements eliminated using a maximum strain criterion). The primary conclusion, therefore, is that an older person&#39;s thorax, relative to a younger, does not necessarily deform more in response to an applied force. The tolerable sternal deflection level is, however, much less.',88,'Kent R','Matsuoka F'),('Potential applications (and limitations) of 3D imaging data from human crash subjects for biomechanical research',2004,'',NULL,'Society of Automotive Engineers. 2004.

This is particularly the case with live human subjects from real-life cases, where little data except age, gender, height and weight have been available to date. With regard to the injuries themselves, previously available data has generally been descriptive and of insufficient granularity and anatomic specificity to provide insight into the path of force loading through the surrounding tissues or the mechanism of injury. Three-dimensional medical imaging has recently become part of the standard evaluation of injured subjects and a growing pool of this data is becoming available to the biomechanical research community. When reviewed in conjunction with detailed crash and vehicle information, this data can provide invaluable information regarding the baseline physical characteristics that may have affected the subject&#39;s injury tolerance as well as insight into injury mechanism. Taken out of the proper context or with improper image processing, portions of this imaging data can be misleading. The objective of this study is to review changes in medical imaging technology over the past two decades as well as changes in its utilization for the standard evaluation of injured patients. Analysis of 3D medical imaging data for biomechanical studies requires image data processing beyond that used during interpretation for clinical purposes&#59; these processes will be reviewed so that members of the biomechanical research community can better understand the potential uses and limitations of this data. The argument will be made for the research community to adopt common standards and procedures. Individual case studies will demonstrate the conditions under which pre-injury body composition data can be extracted from post- injury 3D medical imaging data. Pooled data will demonstrate the association that exists between these body composition data and observed injury tolerance. The implications of this data for the design and validation of finite element models capable of accurately predicting body tolerances to injury will be discussed.',89,'Wang SC','Lange DC'),('Gender Differences in Hip Anatomy&#58; Possible Implications for Injury Tolerance in Frontal Collisions',2004,'',NULL,'Annual Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine. 2004&#59; 48&#58;287-301.','http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Injury+Research+(CIREN)/CIREN+Technical+Publications','Male occupants in frontal motor vehicle collisions have reduced tolerance for hip fractures than females in similar crashes.

Human body characteristics such as height and weight may play an important role. We hypothesized that body mass index (BMI) will influence crash injury patterns. METHODS The University of Michigan Program for Injury Research and Education database was queried. Three cohorts were analyzed, lean (BMI &#60;/&#61; 25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI &#62; 30 kg/m2) RESULTS There were 189 detailed crash cases, with 22 fatalities. There was an increased risk of fatal outcome associated with the obese cohort (adjusted odds ratio, 4.2 compared with lean&#59; p &#61; 0.04). Age, delta-V, seat-belt use, and type of impact were independent predictors of Injury Severity Score (ISS). After adjusting for other modifiers, being overweight was associated with decreased ISS (p &#61; 0.03) and abdominal maximal Abbreviated Injury Scale (mAIS) score (p &#61; 0.008) when compared with the lean cohort. However, the lower extremity mAIS score increased when overweight (p &#61; 0.03) and obese cohorts (p &#61; 0.001) were compared with the lean cohort. CONCLUSION Although no difference in ISS was identified between the lean and obese cohorts, there was an increase in mortality with the obese cohort. The severity of lower extremity injuries increased with increasing BMI. The overweight cohort was associated with lower ISS and abdominal mAIS score compared with the lean cohort. This protection may be attributable to an increase in insulating tissue, or a &#34;cushion effect,&#34; without a significant increase in mass and momentum.',91,'Arbabi S','Wang SC'),('Increased Depth of Subcutaneous Fat is Protective Against Abdominal Injuries in Motor Vehicle Collisions',2003,'',NULL,'Annu Proc Assoc Adv Automot Med. 2003&#59;47&#58;545-59.','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12941250','The objective of this study was to determine the effect of differences in subcutaneous fat depth on adult injury patterns in motor vehicle collisions. Sixty-seven consecutive adult crash subjects aged 19-65 who received computed tomography of their chest, abdomen and pelvis as part of their medical evaluation and who consented to inclusion in the Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) study were included. Subcutaneous fat was measured just lateral to the rectus abdominus muscle in a transverse section taken through the subject at the level of L4. Women had significantly greater subcutaneous fat depth than men. Increased subcutaneous fat depth was associated with significantly decreased injury severity to the abdominal region of females. A similar trend was noted in males although it did not reach statistical significance. Our findings suggest that increased subcutaneous fat may be protective against injuries by cushioning the abdominal region against injurious forces in motor vehicle collisions.',92,'Wang SC','Arbabi S'),('The effect of age and demographics on rib shape and orientation',2017,'June',13,'Journal of Anatomy, (2017), DOI: 10.1111/joa.12632','https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28612467','Elderly populations have a higher risk of rib fractures and other associated thoracic injuries than younger adults, and the changes in body morphology that occur with age are a potential cause of this increased risk. Rib centroidal path geometry for 20 627 ribs was extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans of 1042 live adult subjects, then fitted to a six-parameter mathematical model that accurately characterizes rib size and shape, and a three-parameter model of rib orientation within the body. Multivariable regression characterized the independent effect of age, height, weight, and sex on the rib shape and orientation across the adult population, and statistically significant effects were seen from all demographic factors (P < 0.0001). This study reports a novel aging effect whereby both the rib end-to-end separation and rib aspect ratio are seen to increase with age, producing elongated and flatter overall rib shapes in elderly populations, with age alone explaining up to 20% of population variability in the aspect ratio of mid-level ribs. Age was not strongly associated with overall rib arc length, indicating that age effects were related to shape change rather than overall bone length. The rib shape effect was found to be more strongly and directly associated with age than previously documented age-related changes in rib angulation. Other demographic results showed height and sex being most strongly associated with rib size, and weight most strongly associated with rib pump-handle angle. Results from the study provide a statistical model for building rib shapes typical of any given demographic by age, height, weight, and sex, and can be used to help build population-specific computational models of the thoracic rib cage. Furthermore, results also quantify normal population ranges for rib shape parameters which can be used to improve the assessment and treatment of rib skeletal deformity and disease.',105,'Holcombe SA','Grotberg JB'),('Age-related changes in thoracic skeletal geometry of elderly females.

DOI 10.1080/15389588.2017.1309526','https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28332867','OBJECTIVE: Both females and the elderly have been identified as vulnerable populations with increased injury and mortality risk in multiple crash scenarios. Particularly in frontal impacts, older females show higher risk to the chest and thorax than their younger or male counterparts. Thoracic geometry plays a role in this increase, and this study aims to quantify key parts of that geometry in a way that can directly inform human body models that incorporate the concept of person age. METHODS: Computed tomography scans from 2 female subject groups aged 20-35 and 65-99 were selected from the International Center for Automotive Medicine scan database representing young and old female populations. A model of thoracic skeletal anatomy was built for each subject from independent parametric models of the spine, ribs, and sternum, along with further parametric models of those components\' spatial relationships. Parameter values between the 2 groups are directly compared, and average parameter values within each group are used to generate statistically average skeletal geometry for young and old females. In addition to the anatomic measures explicitly used in the parameterization scheme, key measures of rib cage depth and spine curvature are taken from both the underlying subject pool and from the resultant representative geometries. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were seen between the young and old groups\' spine and rib anatomic components, with no significant differences in local sternal geometry found. Vertebral segments in older females had higher angles relative to their inferior neighbors, providing a quantification of the kyphotic curvature known to be associated with age. Ribs in older females had greater end-to-end span, greater aspect ratio, and reduced out-of-plane deviation, producing an elongated and overall flatter curvature that leads to distal rib ends extending further anteriorly in older individuals. Combined differences in spine curvature and rib geometry led to an 18-mm difference in anterior placement of the sternum between young and old subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new geometric data regarding the variability in anthropometry of adult females with age and has utility in advancing the veracity of current human body models. A simplified scaffold representation of underlying 3-dimensional bones within the thorax is presented, and the reported young and old female parameter sets can be used to characterize the anatomic differences expected with age and to both validate and drive morphing algorithms for aged human body models. The modular approach taken allows model parameters to hold inherent and intuitive meaning, offering advantages over more generalized methods such as principal component analysis. Geometry can be assessed on a component level or a whole thorax level, and the parametric representation of thorax shape allows direct comparisons between the current study and other individuals or human body models.',106,'Holcombe SA','Grotberg JB');

Currently, his efforts focus on clinical management and tracking of patients with fragility fractures, including establishment of complementary fragility fracture services and geriatric fracture services. His contributions to science have focused on clinically related areas. Initially, the focus was on the biomechanics of clinical fracture fixation. Based on the high variability of bone formation in clinical models of distraction osteogenesis, he became interested in creating a more predictably favorable environment for bone formation. Dr. Goulet worked with a team to develop a model to explore the relationship between bone formation and the mechanical environment to bone formation in distraction osteogenesis. Using microCT and mechanical testing, he demonstrated significant differences between bone formed under conditions of continual tension and bone formed during fracture healing, and reported on variations in bone formation related to the stability of external fixation and the pattern of bone distraction. Most recently, Dr. Goulet has been involved in using engineering segmentation applications to create high throughput analysis of CT scans to determine variability in bone shape and density. Each of the projects have been highly clinically oriented to answer specific and directed clinical questions. Our initial publications have studied the shape of the femur to aid in better design of femoral intramedullary implants and the shape of the sacrum to better determine safe pathways for placement of screws used for sacral fracture fixation.','faculty','james_goulet.png','image/png',76241,'2017-09-24 05:59:01'),(12,'Holcombe','Sven','M.S.','Crash Safety Engineer, ICAM/MAG','http://med.umich.edu/surgery/stewartcwang/team_headshots/faculty/sven_holcombe.png','Sven is currently completing his PhD in Biomedical Engineering.
