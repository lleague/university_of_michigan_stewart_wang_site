              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">In the past, both government and industry have depended on mechanical crash dummies for automotive safety research and development. While these dummies have led to many improvements in crash safety, computational modeling offers the potential for faster advances without the need for prior dummy and instrumentation development.</p>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">There is now general recognition that computer based human finite element models will be the foundation for future safety testing and development. The sustained exponential increase in computational speed is expected to continue and will make the use of these complex models feasible. Medical researchers will need to lead the way and we are the foremost research group in the world utilizing medical imaging data from real-life crashes to determine the effect of body composition on injury tolerance.</p>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">We see clear signs of markedly increased industrial and governmental funding for human body modeling research in the near future and this center will be optimally positioned to lead the international effort if it has the institutional support and facilities to recruit faculty with expertise in computational biomechanics. To the extent that test dummies and instrumentation are needed for validation or regulatory testing, advances in human finite element modeling will provide necessary input for dummy development and injury reference values. These computational human body models also have tremendous potential outside automotive safety such as the development of medical devices or artificial joints as well as virtual trainers.</p>

              <h4 class="bold dark_gray padding_bottom_half">Human Body Models</h4>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">Historically, crash test dummies or Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs) were modeled after cadavers and subjected to test crashes of all types, and while invaluable insights have been generated from that research, even more can be done via Human Body Models (HBM), both virtually and with the physical ATD forms.</p>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">Currently, there are three types of crash testing modes:</p>
              <ol class="padding_left_four">
                <li>Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs)- physical</li>
                <li>Anthropomorphic Test Devices based on Human Body Models (ATD FEM)- physical</li>
                <li>Finite Element Modeling- Human Body (FEM)- virtual</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">With FEM, otherwise known as virtual modeling, there is great potential to improve injury assessment and treatment, as well as assist in the prevention of injuries during Motor Vehicle Crashes (MVCs.) For automotive engineers, safety researchers, and clinicians, virtual human body models expand the collision conditions and occupant configurations so that they may be studied beyond what is possible with expensive repeated physical tests with standard ATDs. With recent advances in computing it has become far more informative and less expensive to use computers to manage the modeling.</p>
              <h4 class="bold dark_gray padding_bottom_half">Expertise</h4>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">For almost 20 years, ICAM has collected and documented real-life MVCs in unmatched detail. From the subsequent analysis of this data, and the processing and analysis of thousands of CT scans from crash and non-crash subjects alike; ICAM has the data and capability to help create more detailed and anatomically correct human body models of any stature, age, and gender.</p>
              <h4 class="bold dark_gray padding_bottom_half">Focus on a vulnerable population</h4>
              <p class="padding_bottom_one margin_bottom_one">ICAM has partnered with Toyota and Humanetics Innovative Solutions to expand and improve upon existing methods of crash testing by utilizing the Centerâ€™s next generation data for geometry and material properties. By concentrating on the development and validation of a set of elderly crash test devices based on computer modeling, the partnership seeks to better protect one of the most vulnerable and underserved populations related to MVCs.</p>
