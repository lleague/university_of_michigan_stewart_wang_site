Currently, his efforts focus on clinical management and tracking of patients with fragility fractures, including establishment of complementary fragility fracture services and geriatric fracture services. His contributions to science have focused on clinically related areas. Initially, the focus was on the biomechanics of clinical fracture fixation. Based on the high variability of bone formation in clinical models of distraction osteogenesis, he became interested in creating a more predictably favorable environment for bone formation. Dr. Goulet worked with a team to develop a model to explore the relationship between bone formation and the mechanical environment to bone formation in distraction osteogenesis. Using microCT and mechanical testing, he demonstrated significant differences between bone formed under conditions of continual tension and bone formed during fracture healing, and reported on variations in bone formation related to the stability of external fixation and the pattern of bone distraction. Most recently, Dr. Goulet has been involved in using engineering segmentation applications to create high throughput analysis of CT scans to determine variability in bone shape and density. Each of the projects have been highly clinically oriented to answer specific and directed clinical questions. Our initial publications have studied the shape of the femur to aid in better design of femoral intramedullary implants and the shape of the sacrum to better determine safe pathways for placement of screws used for sacral fracture fixation.",faculty
